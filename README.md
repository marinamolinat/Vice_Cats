## Overview

Vice Cats is a silly Chrome extension designed to make users more mindful about the videos they consume. Before watching any video, users are prompted to write the reason why they wish to watch it, helping reduce compulsive content consumption.

The extension features a retro, psychedelic, cyberpunk-ish aesthetic. In the future, I hope to add new features and publish it in the Chrome Web Store.

The popup of the extension displays your current Vice Cat and the history of videos you've watched â€” along with the reasons you gave for watching them. If you haven't used the extension yet, this section will be blank.
